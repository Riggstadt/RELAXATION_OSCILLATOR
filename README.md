# Comparator-based Relaxation Oscillator
This projects covers the theory behind using a comparator (or a really fast op-amp) as a foundation for a relaxation oscillator. Such oscillators have many uses, some more frequent ones being:
- Clock generator for digital systems
- PWM generation
## Theoretical considerations
This section covers the proper derivation of the oscillation frequency as a function of the RC time constant of the circuit.
